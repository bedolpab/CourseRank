Students become familiar with the cultures of this era, adept at identifying and comparing the characteristics of their art, and understand how art production is linked to social, political, economic, religious, and historical conditions. Beginning with prehistoric art by identifying basic forms and methods of creating before it was defined as art, students learn about early civilizations in the Near East, Egypt, and the Aegean in which art began in service to rulers and to demarcate cities. The course examines the art of Greece and Rome as the foundation for the formation of Western civilization. Definitions of art and culture include that made concurrently in Southeast Asia, China, Korea, Japan, the Americas, and Africa and facilitate an understanding of diverse belief systems and organizational structures. Examinations of Islamic, Byzantine, Jewish, and early Christian art facilitate a comparative analysis of devotional art. The art and architecture of the early Medieval, Romanesque, and Gothic periods help illustrate the Medieval Era and the formation of secular and religious socio-political and economic systems who have common or conflicting agendas. Upon completion of this course, students should have a broad knowledge of global art and its diverse forms and purposes prior to the 14th century."

    "description": "This course presents a history of art since the fourteenth century. Students become familiar with different art styles and develop the ability to identify recurring themes, forms, and agendas in art as it progresses through time periods, regions, countries, and continents. Ultimately, the course illustrates how art is linked to social, political, economic, religious, and historic conditions, as well as other arts such as drama, music, and literature. The examination is a global one, and includes European and American art; indigenous art of the Americas; Southeast Asian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and African art; and the art of Pacific cultures. An important part of the class discussion addresses the cultural appropriations, aggressions, and obliterations that are part of the exchanges initiated by European exploration and colonization. Another element of the class explores the role of art in the development and transmutations of religions, such as reformations of the powerful Catholic church, culture-specific adaptations of Buddhist imagery, and what liturgical art was incorporated into the development of Protestantism. The course also highlights the increasing social status of artists, who were largely unknown in the previous era, but, by the time of the Renaissance, had attained celebrity status. Of particular note to this era as well is the way art was used in nation-building-from its contributions to revolutions, to documenting historic moments, and to defining national identities. At the completion of this course, students will have a broad knowledge of art in all its diverse forms and purposes."

    "description": "Looking at art made primarily during your lifetime, this course investigates what contemporary art is by looking at and talking about some of the most well-known artists. Artists are examined according themes, such as the use of technology, sexuality, and materialism. Takashi Murakami animated a Kanye West video, Eduardo Kac crossed the genes of a jellyfish with a rabbit and created a bunny that glows in the dark. Many artists create controversial art through the materials they use-such as encrusting a human skull with diamonds (Damien Hirst) making it the most expensive art work ever made or affixing elephant dung to a painting of the Madonna (Chris Ofili). Still other artists make art that addresses contemporary issues: Vik Muniz photographs people who must forage garbage dumps in order to survive and Betsy Damon makes art that purifies water. Assignments include an art review, short papers, and discussions. No art or art history background is needed for this course-it is designed for anyone who wants to learn how to look at the images around them and understand their impact on society and themselves."

The semester goal is to create a coherent context, through lectures and readings and the exploration of artists and themes, while recognizing the diverse character of the art of this period. We examine popular movements such as Impressionism, well-known periods such as Abstract Expressionism, and redefining types of art known as performance, body, and earthworks. In addition, we explore how the art of the past 150 years was often produced by men and women reacting to events or conditions occurring in their lifetimes, such as world wars or sexual liberation. The class emphasizes painting and sculpture but includes some discussion of photography, design, mixed media, popular culture, and other types of art and media produced during this era."

These include such as artists as Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot, who were integral to the Impressionists, and Lee Krasner and Elaine DeKooning, who were driving forces for Abstract Expressionism, feminist art of the 1970s, environmental and social justice artists, and postmodern and contemporary artists who challenge identity and history such as Pipilotti Rist, Catherine Opie, Yael Bartana, Tania Bruguera, and Kara Walker. Attitudes about gender in Western culture and critical analyses related to gender-such as “the gaze” and gender as a construction or performance-are considered in order to understand issues surrounding women and art."

We will study the history and culture of hip-hop’s four elements: DJing, MCing, break dancing, and graffiti art. We will also examine the notion of hip-hop as a component of black world consciousness through local, national, and international examples. In assessing hip-hop as art and action, themes of politicization, identity, poverty, criminality, authenticity, language, sports, gender, and race will be examined."

    "description": "From the earliest records of human civilization in Africa, there is a clear anthropomorphism of nature. All true ecological examinations of Africa must begin at this point. Much of what has been called “fetish” in Africa has to do with the African recognition of the sacred bond and interdependence that humans have with nature. This course will journey through African mythology art and religious symbols to find evidence of nature appreciation and conservation. We will explore the nature conservation practices that African people brought to the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Lastly we will probe into the current, Afrocentric environmental justice movement in Africa and in the diaspora. The course will cover the life stories of African environment champions like Ken Saro-Wiwa, Wangari Maathai, Benjamin Chavis, Majora Carter, and many others."

This course utilizes a foundational standpoint that historically situates race as both a sociocultural construct and (to a lesser extent) a biological reality in an effort to examine and explore issues of privilege that often arise from the rhetoric surrounding the concept of race. In an effort to help students understand how prevailing notions of racial identity can affect communication of all kinds, they will be asked to engage with and analyze public discourses regarding interracial communication from a variety of cultural and historical contexts. Ultimately, students will learn that while interracial communication functions as one aspect of the larger field of intercultural studies, such communication must nevertheless be considered through various lenses, such as ethnic and national identities.

Throughout the course, techniques for adding sound, 2D and 3D graphics, and ‘viewing’, animations, particle systems, and ancillary features (e.g. images from a DVD) to games are also presented. In implementing games, the student uses a software game-development package called GameMaker Studio.
