# CourseRank
CourseRank is a repository that contains an implementation of a course ranking algorithm that uses the BM25 scoring function. This algorithm can be used to rank courses based on their relevance to a given search query.

## How it works
The BM25 scoring function is a well-known ranking algorithm. It calculates the relevance of a document to a search query based on the frequency of the query terms in the document and the inverse frequency of those terms in the corpus of documents. The algorithm uses the BM25 scoring function to rank courses based on how well they match a given search query. The corpus of documents in this case is a set of course descriptions, and the search query is a user's query for courses.
